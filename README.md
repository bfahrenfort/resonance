Building from source
----------------------

To build from source you need the gstreamer, gtk4 and libadwaita development headers. Additionally you'll need meson, ninja and git. You'll also need those python runtime libraries: mutagen, tqdm and loguru.

On a recent enough Ubuntu or Debian unstable you can do the following:

```
sudo apt install build-essential rustc meson ninja-build git python3-loguru python3-mutagen python3-tqdm libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev \
libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
git clone https://github.com/nate-xyz/resonance && cd resonance
meson build
ninja -C build && sudo ninja -C build install

```
To uninstall run ```sudo ninja -C build uninstall```.

## Arch Linux
Initial script provided for 0.1.3.

Available in the [AUR.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/resonance)
